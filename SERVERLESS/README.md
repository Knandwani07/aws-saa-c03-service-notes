# ⚡ AWS Serverless Service Category

This directory contains documentation for AWS services that enable developers to run code, containers, and workloads without provisioning or managing servers.  
These services support fully managed compute models, event-driven executions, and container-based serverless deployments.

# 📘 What Each Service Document Covers

Each service file in this category includes:

1. **What the Service Is** – Clear definition and serverless compute role.  
2. **Key Features** – Main operational and architectural capabilities.  
3. **Use Cases** – Practical scenarios where the service fits best.  
4. **Benefits** – Why the service is chosen for modern workloads.  
5. **Pricing** – High-level pricing model and cost factors.  
6. **Integration** – How the service connects across AWS services.  
7. **Exam Tips** – SAA-C03 relevant distinctions and patterns.  
8. **Quick Summary** – A short recap to support rapid revision.

This structure ensures consistency across all serverless documentation.

# 📁 Services Included in This Category  
(Ordered **exactly** as they appear in the File Index)

| Service | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **AWS Fargate** | Serverless compute engine for running containers (ECS/EKS) without managing servers, clusters, or scaling logic. |
| **AWS Lambda** | Event-driven serverless compute that runs code on demand and scales automatically with pay-per-execution pricing. |

# 📂 File Index

Each file contains deep architectural notes, pricing insights, and exam-ready details.

# 🗺 How to Use This Section

• Start with the table to understand the serverless compute options.  
• Open individual `.md` files for detailed architecture insights and usage patterns.  
• Use “Exam Tips” and “Quick Summary” for SAA-C03 preparation.  
• Ideal for understanding event-driven architectures and serverless compute models.
