# 🌐 AWS Networking and Content Delivery Services Category

This directory contains structured documentation for AWS networking services used to securely connect applications, route traffic, accelerate global performance, and deliver content at scale.  
These services enable hybrid connectivity, traffic distribution, DNS routing, edge delivery, and network governance.

# 📘 What Each Service Document Covers

Each service file in this category includes:

1. **What the Service Is** – Clear definition and networking role.  
2. **Key Features** – Main technical capabilities.  
3. **Use Cases** – Common networking and routing scenarios.  
4. **Benefits** – Why the service is used in cloud and hybrid architectures.  
5. **Pricing** – High-level pricing considerations.  
6. **Integration** – How the service interacts with AWS networking components.  
7. **Exam Tips** – SAA-C03 exam patterns and key distinctions.  
8. **Quick Summary** – Short recap for fast revision.

This ensures consistent documentation across all networking services.

# 📁 Services Included in This Category  
(Ordered **exactly** according to the File Index)

| Service | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Amazon CloudFront** | Global CDN that caches and serves content from edge locations. Provides low latency, DDoS protection, and edge compute. |
| **Amazon Route 53** | Scalable DNS service with routing policies, traffic flow, and health checks. Used to direct users to the right endpoints globally. |
| **Amazon VPC** | Virtual private cloud providing subnets, route tables, NAT, security groups, NACLs, gateways, and custom networking environments. |
| **AWS Direct Connect** | Dedicated, private network link from on-premises to AWS. Offers stable throughput and lower latency than public internet. |
| **AWS Global Accelerator** | Improves global application performance using AWS’s global network with static IPs and intelligent routing. |
| **AWS Transit Gateway** | Central hub for connecting multiple VPCs and on-prem networks, simplifying large multi-VPC architectures. |
| **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)** | Distributes incoming traffic across multiple targets. Includes ALB (HTTP/HTTPS), NLB (TCP/UDP), and CLB (legacy). |
