# 🚚 AWS Migration and Transfer Services Category

This directory contains documentation for AWS services that support migrating applications, servers, databases, large datasets, and file workloads from on-premises environments into AWS.  
These tools enable lift-and-shift migrations, data transfer acceleration, hybrid workflows, and centralized migration tracking.

# 📘 What Each Service Document Covers

Each service file in this category includes:

1. **What the Service Is** – Clear definition and migration role.  
2. **Key Features** – Core capabilities and architectural principles.  
3. **Use Cases** – Typical migration and transfer scenarios.  
4. **Benefits** – Why the service is used during modernization or migration.  
5. **Pricing** – High-level pricing considerations.  
6. **Integration** – How the service works with other AWS migration tools.  
7. **Exam Tips** – SAA-C03 exam patterns and distinctions.  
8. **Quick Summary** – Final recap for quick revision.

This structure ensures consistent documentation across all migration and transfer tools.
