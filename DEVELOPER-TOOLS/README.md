# 🛠️ AWS Developer Tools Category

This directory includes documentation for AWS services used to build, test, monitor, and debug modern distributed applications.  
These tools support observability, performance analysis, and troubleshooting across microservices, serverless architectures, and API-driven workloads.

# 📘 What Each Service Document Covers

Each service file in this category includes:

1. **What the Service Is** – Clear definition and role in application monitoring.  
2. **Key Features** – Core capabilities and technical characteristics.  
3. **Use Cases** – Common scenarios for debugging and performance evaluation.  
4. **Benefits** – Why the service is valuable in development workflows.  
5. **Pricing** – High-level pricing model and cost considerations.  
6. **Integration** – How the service works with other AWS components.  
7. **Exam Tips** – SAA-C03 exam patterns and commonly tested distinctions.
