# ⚙️ AWS Compute Service Category

This directory contains structured documentation for AWS compute services used to run workloads across virtual machines, managed platforms, hybrid environments, serverless ecosystems, and edge locations.  
Each file provides detailed notes essential for architecture decisions and AWS SAA-C03 exam preparation.

# 📘 What Each Service Document Covers

Each service file in this category follows the standard structure:

1. **What the Service Is** – Clear definition and compute role.  
2. **Key Features** – Main capabilities and architectural characteristics.  
3. **Use Cases** – Common deployment and workload scenarios.  
4. **Benefits** – Why the service is chosen in production.  
5. **Pricing** – High-level pricing model and key cost factors.  
6. **Integration** – Interaction with other AWS compute/networking components.  
7. **Exam Tips** – Frequently tested SAA-C03 patterns.  
8. **Quick Summary** – Final condensed recap.

This format ensures consistency across all compute service documentation.

# 📁 Services Included in This Category  
(Ordered **exactly** as they appear in the File Index)

| Service | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling** | Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand to maintain performance and optimize cost. |
| **Amazon EC2** | Resizable virtual servers providing complete control over OS, networking, storage, and compute scale. |
| **AWS Batch** | Fully managed batch computing service that runs large-scale jobs by provisioning compute resources automatically. |
| **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** | Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for deploying applications without managing servers; handles scaling, patching, and load balancing. |
| **AWS Outposts** | Extends AWS infrastructure and services to on-premises data centers for low-latency or data-residency needs. |
| **AWS Serverless Application Repository (SAR)** | Collection of ready-to-deploy serverless applications built on AWS Lambda, published by AWS and the community. |
| **AWS Wavelength** | Provides ultra-low-latency compute at 5G edge locations for applications needing near real-time responsiveness. |
