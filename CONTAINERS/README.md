# 🐳 AWS Containers Service Category

This directory contains structured documentation for AWS services used to build, run, orchestrate, and manage containerized applications across cloud, hybrid, and on-prem environments.  
Each service plays a key role in container lifecycle management, registry operations, and Kubernetes/ECS orchestration.

# 📘 What Each Service Document Covers

Each service file in this category includes:

1. **What the Service Is** – Clear definition and container orchestration role.  
2. **Key Features** – Core capabilities and technical characteristics.  
3. **Use Cases** – Practical deployment and operational scenarios.  
4. **Benefits** – Why the service is valuable in production.  
5. **Pricing** – High-level pricing model and cost considerations.  
6. **Integration** – How the service interacts with other AWS and container tools.  
7. **Exam Tips** – SAA-C03 exam patterns and commonly tested distinctions.  
8. **Quick Summary** – A short revision-friendly recap.

This consistent format ensures clarity and reliable study flow.
