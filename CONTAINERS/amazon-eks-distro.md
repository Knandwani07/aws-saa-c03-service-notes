# Amazon EKS Distro (EKS-D)

Amazon EKS Distro (EKS-D) is the open-source Kubernetes distribution that powers Amazon EKS.  
It provides the same Kubernetes versions, patches, and security updates used in EKS, delivered for use on any infrastructure.

---

## What It Is

• Open-source Kubernetes distribution maintained by AWS  
• Uses the same versioned and security-hardened components as Amazon EKS  
• Can run on AWS, on-premises, or in other cloud environments  
• AWS supplies ongoing patches, bug fixes, and security updates  
• Ensures full compatibility with Amazon EKS clusters  

---

## Key Features

• Open-source, CNCF-compliant Kubernetes distribution  
• Same binaries, patches, and Kubernetes lifecycle as Amazon EKS  
• Portable across any environment — on-prem, cloud, hybrid  
• AWS-maintained updates aligned with EKS releases  
• Enhances cluster stability, predictability, and security  
• Designed for compatibility with EKS control planes and tooling  

---

## Benefits

• Consistent Kubernetes operations across cloud, on-prem, and multi-cloud setups  
• Enhanced transparency into Kubernetes components and updates  
• Security updates and patches remain aligned with Amazon EKS  
• Ideal for custom or isolated Kubernetes environments requiring EKS compatibility  
• Reduces operational drift between self-managed clusters and EKS-managed clusters  

---

## Use Cases

• Self-managed Kubernetes clusters needing EKS consistency  
• Air-gapped or disconnected environments  
• Multi-cloud Kubernetes deployments  
• On-premises platforms requiring predictable Kubernetes versions  
• Regulated industries needing full control over their Kubernetes distribution  

---

## Exam Tips

• EKS-D = Open-source Kubernetes distribution behind Amazon EKS  
• Uses the same tested, secure components as EKS  
• Ensures compatibility for hybrid Kubernetes environments  
• Can run anywhere — not limited to AWS infrastructure  

---

## Quick Summary

Amazon EKS Distro provides the same secure, tested, and version-aligned Kubernetes components used in Amazon EKS.  
It enables consistent Kubernetes operations across on-premises, cloud, multi-cloud, and air-gapped environments — making it ideal for teams that want EKS compatibility without relying on AWS-managed control planes.
