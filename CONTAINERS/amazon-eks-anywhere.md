# Amazon EKS Anywhere

Amazon EKS Anywhere lets you create and operate Kubernetes clusters on your own infrastructure while still using EKS-compatible tooling. It extends the Amazon EKS experience to on-premises and edge environments without requiring AWS-managed control planes.

---

## Key Features

• Run Kubernetes clusters locally using familiar EKS tooling  
• Operate clusters fully on-prem with no AWS infrastructure dependency  
• Uses the same APIs, CLI, and management experience as Amazon EKS  
• Supports VMware vSphere and bare metal environments  
• Integrates with GitOps workflows for consistent, automated deployments  

---

## Key Features

• Run Kubernetes clusters anywhere: on-prem, edge, datacenters  
• No AWS control plane required — clusters are self-managed locally  
• Supports vSphere and bare-metal provisioning  
• EKS console and EKS CLI integration for visibility and lifecycle tools  
• GitOps support using Flux for declarative cluster and app management  
• Lifecycle automation tools for upgrades, configuration, and troubleshooting  

---

## Benefits

• Bring Kubernetes to your own datacenters with EKS consistency  
• Maintain a unified operational model across cloud and on-prem clusters  
• Ideal for hybrid and multi-cloud architectures  
• Reduced latency for workloads that must run locally  
• Helps meet compliance and data-residency requirements  
• Enables consistent tooling for DevOps teams across environments  

---

## Use Cases

• Hybrid Kubernetes platforms spanning AWS + on-prem  
• Regulated industries requiring full local control of clusters  
• Edge computing environments with low-latency needs  
• Organizations modernizing on-prem apps with Kubernetes  
• Multi-cloud strategies using consistent EKS-based operations  

---

## Exam Tips

• EKS Anywhere = Run self-managed Kubernetes clusters on-prem using EKS tooling  
• No AWS-managed control plane required  
• Supports vSphere and bare-metal deployments  
• GitOps with Flux is a core part of the workflow  
• Designed for hybrid, multi-cloud, and regulated environments
