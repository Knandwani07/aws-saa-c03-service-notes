# AWS Management Console

---

## What It Is

The AWS Management Console is a web-based interface that allows you to visually manage and interact with AWS services without using the CLI or SDKs. It acts as your central control room for navigating and configuring AWS resources.

## Key Features

• Web-based UI for managing AWS services  
• Global search bar for quick navigation to services, docs, and recent resources  
• Resource dashboard for monitoring active resources, usage, and billing  
• Service favourites for pinning frequently used services  
• Account management for users, billing, regions, and support settings  
• Integrated access to CloudShell, Cloud9, and seamless switching to CLI  

---

## Use Cases

• Creating and managing EC2 instances, RDS databases, and S3 buckets manually  
• Managing IAM users, roles, permissions, and MFA  
• Monitoring workloads using CloudWatch dashboards  
• Viewing billing reports, cost explorer, and service quota usage  

---

## Exam Tips

• Console is region-specific, always verify the selected Region  
• Some services like IAM and CloudFront are global, not Region-bound  
• CloudShell is available directly in the console for CLI access  
• For automation and repeatable deployments, use CLI, SDKs, CloudFormation, or CDK instead of the console

## Quick Summary

A visual, browser-based interface to manage AWS services. Great for manual setup, testing, exploration, and billing insights — but not intended for automation or large-scale operations.
