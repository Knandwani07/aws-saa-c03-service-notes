Identify idle, unused, or underutilized resources.  
Examples:  
• Underutilized EC2

### **2. Performance**  
Improve application and resource performance.  
Examples:  
• Instance type mismatches

### **3. Security**  
Detect security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.  
Examples:  
• MFA on root account  
• Public S3 buckets  
• Open security groups  
• Weak IAM password policy  

### **4. Fault Tolerance**  
Increase resiliency and availability.  
Examples:  
• Multi-AZ usage  
• Auto Scaling checks  
• EBS snapshot adherence  

### **5. Service Limits**  
Ensure resources don’t reach AWS-imposed quotas.  
Examples:
